# openCV-Image-processing

In this repository we can see the basics of openCV and some important operations performed on images and videos namely
Thresholding,Blending,Basic geometric transformations,Adaptive thresholding,Affine transformation,perspective transformation,Smoothing of images,Template matching,corners detection,edge detection,line detections,opticalFlow,object tracking with different methods,Feature matching,Feature detection.

By the end, you will have good understanding of OpenCV library which have many useful functions callable for Images and videos processings.
These are helpful in computer vision technology and also while developing Deep learning projects using Images and videos data.
